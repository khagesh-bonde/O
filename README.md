Step by step, you can upload your video on YouTube.

2. Open the YouTube homepage. 

3. Click on the "Sign In" button at the top right-hand corner of the page. 

4. Sign in using your YouTube, Google

right-hand corner of the page. 

6. Click the upload button that's located on the top of the homepage to the 

right of the search bar. 

7. Choose the video you want to upload. 

Go to "Select Files To Upload" to open the browser, then find the file you want 

to add. 

8. Before uploading your file, you will need to choose your privacy settings

from the center drop-down menu where four different options will appear. 

 Public: Your video content is available for anyone to see. It also appears in 

the search results and recommendations across YouTube. 

 Unlisted: Your uploaded video is on YouTube, but only those with the video 

URL (sharing link) can view it. 

 Private: Your video is on YouTube, but only you can see it when logged into

recording before you begin the upload as well. 

10. Next, you will need to add your YouTube video details. 

There are three required pieces of information which are the title of your 

video, the description of your video, and any tags (keywords) you want to add 

to your video. You can also add other features such as hashtags, thumbnails, end screens and cards, etc. as well. 
 Title: This is the name of your video and should contain your relevant 

keywords naturally so your content appears in the YouTube searches and the 

users click to watch option. 

 Description: Here is where you add your hashtags and detailed information 

about the video. You should provide context for the video content, as well as 

relevant external links. 

 Tags: These are the keywords you researched and determined to be the best 

possible fit for your video 

 Thumbnails: You can use the thumbnails that YouTube automatically 

recommends or you can use custom thumbnails. We recommend custom 

thumbnails because the thumbnail is so important. The thumbnail is the 

attention-grabbing feature that will catch the viewer's eye and make them want 

to click on and watch your video. 

 Hashtags: If you add two to three hashtags in your video description, 

YouTube will automatically take the hashtags you posted and display them 

above your video's title. Hashtags improve search ability, give your video more 

visibility, and make your video much easier for a viewer to find, and more. 

 End Screens and Cards: These help promote your brand and extend the 

watch time on your video channel. 

 Getting Subscribers: This can be done in several ways which are linking 

your new video to other videos, adding external links, commenting on related 

videos, using social media to promote your video. 

11. Lastly, you will need save the video. 

This will save your title, description and everything else after your video is done 

uploading. Once you see that the progress bar has been filled, you will know it 

has been posted on YouTube. You can then take your newly uploaded video and 

embed it on your website, share it online, or anything else you would like to do with it.
